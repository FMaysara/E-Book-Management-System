<h2>Book Summary</h2><br>
<p>Admittedly I was a little nervous coming to Black Mouth, as I absolutely adored Come With Me by Ronald Malfi last year. After all, there's always the real possibility that a beloved author's next book won't live up to expectations, but whew, I can assure you this was definitely not the case here. In the end, I think I enjoyed Black Mouth just as much, if not even more.
The story follows Jamie Warren, who for nearly twenty years has been haunted by a darkness from his past. In the time since, he's been struggling with alcohol addiction and trying to hold down a steady job, but at last, he is forced to stop running, brought back to his hometown of Sutton's Quay, Virginia following the news of his mother's suicide. With her gone, Jamie now becomes the primary caretaker for his disabled younger brother Dennis, whom police had found wandering the streets alone.
Back in Sutton's Quay, Jamie also reconnects with his childhood friends Mia and Clay. The three of them have a lot of history, having gone through the same traumatic experience that had driven Jamie away. As children, Jamie, Dennis, Mia, and Clay used to play in the woods near the town's old abandoned mine near the Warren farm, where they encountered a vagrant who befriended them and entertained with magic tricks. But as the Magician's interactions with them became increasingly stranger and more disturbing, he eventually manipulated the impressionable children to commit a terrible act, and to this day Jamie has not been able to forgive himself.
Now though, another murder has made the news, that of a young girl stabbed to death by a friend. The details surrounding the case immediately catch Jamie's attention, as the circumstances sound eerily similar to what he and his friends went through two decades earlier. But surely, after all these years, the Magician must be gone? And yet, when Mia shows them all a photo that she came across which was only taken a few days ago, the identity of the man in it is unmistakable. The Magician appears to have returned, as impossible as it seems, and he is still targeting young victims.
